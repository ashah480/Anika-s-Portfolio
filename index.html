                <p>I designed an app during a UX/UI internship at Rutgers University. I went through the process of storyboarding, wireframing and prototyping to develop a sleeping app called "Sleep Haven" that plays therapeutic sounds and tracks the user's heartbeat during the different stages of sleep by connecting with an Apple Watch. The app also provides information about the quality of the user's REM sleep and how it relates to other people of their age range and gender. There are even automatic timers so the sounds will be able to stop playing when the user falls asleep.</p>
